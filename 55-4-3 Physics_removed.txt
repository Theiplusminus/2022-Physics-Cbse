SECTION C

12.  Two transparent media of refractive indices n1 and n2 are separated by a spherical transparent surface. The rays of light incident on the surface
get refracted into the medium on the other side. The laws of refraction are valid at each point of the spherical surface. A lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces, at least one of which should be spherical. The focal length of a lens is determined by the radii of
curvature (R1 and R2) of its two surfaces and the refractive index (n) of the  medium  of  the  lens  with  respect  to  the  surrounding  medium.
Depending on R1 and R2, a lens behaves as a diverging or a converging lens. The ability of a lens to diverge or converge a beam of light incident
on it defines its power.
