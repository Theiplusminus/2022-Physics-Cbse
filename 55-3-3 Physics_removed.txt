SECTION-C CASE STUDY
12. A compound microscope consists of two converging lenses. One of them, of smaller aperture and smaller focal length is called objective and the other of slightly larger aperture and slightly larger focal length is called eye-piece. Both the lenses are fitted in a tube with an arrangement to vary the distance between them. A tiny object is placed in front of the objective at a distance slightly greater than its focal length. The objective produces the image of the object which acts as an object for the eye-piece. The eye piece, in turn produces the final magnified image.	1 x 5 = 5
I. In a compound microscope the images formed by the objective and the eye-piece are respectively

(A) virtual, real
(C) virtual, virtual

real, virtual
(D) real, real
