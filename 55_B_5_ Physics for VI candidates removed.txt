SECTION C

12. When light passes through a narrow aperture or falls on an obstacle of very small dimensions, it bends into the shadow region. The bending of light waves around the corners and edges of the obstacles as well as aperture is called diffraction of light. For prominent diffraction effect, the size of the aperture or obstacle must be comparable to the wavelength of the light used. If we place a screen in front of the slit, a broad central maxima and a few alternate dark and bright bands of successively decreasing intensities on either sides of central bright band are obtained on the screen.
(a) Light of wavelength  falls normally on a slit of width a . The diffraction due to the slit will be most prominently observed when :
(i) a = 5	(ii)   a = 100
(iii)  a = 103	(iv)   a = 105

(b) When monochromatic light is replaced by white light, then :
(i) the diffraction pattern disappears.
(ii) the diffraction band becomes circular.
(iii) a white band is formed at the centre and coloured bands are formed at both its sides.
(iv) only a white band is formed at the centre.
(c) If in a diffraction experiment, the width of the slit is slightly increased, then the central maximum of the diffraction pattern becomes :
(i) broader and brighter.
(ii) broader and fainter.
(iii) narrow and brighter.
(iv) narrow and fainter.

(i) 0·16 mm	(ii)   0·20 mm
